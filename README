JPS is a rotation bot, this copy is for private servers running 3.3.5a. You will need a LUA unlocker to use this addon. Right now the following classes/specs are supported (PvE only):

Paladin: Retribution, Protection, Holy (in progress)
Death Knight: Blood
Rogue: Assassination

Contact me about adding support for other classes and specs.


In-game use the following commands:
  /jps e = enable jps
  /jps d = disable jps
  /jps t = toggle jps on/off
  /jps multi = toggle aoe/single target rotations
  /jps pew = calls jps.combat() function (spam this to perform rotation with jps disabled)
